#Mathematical Machinery

There is a lot of mathematical machinery to Maxwell's Equations.

To approach Maxwell's Equations, you need to understand:

##Vectors

These are a way to work with coordinates in 3 dimensions.
#!!Katex: \begin{bmatrix}0.1 \\ 1.7 \\ 0.3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ -0.2 \\ 0.1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\ 1.5 \\ 0.4 \end{bmatrix} \,

##Trigonometry

Trig gives us the important functions, *sine* and *cosine*, which as well as helping us calculate the lengths of sides in triangles are also important in waves.

##Complex Numbers

Complex number arise when you allow "the square root of minus one", also known as *'i'*, to be treated as a valid number.

##Simultaneous Equations

An equation in a single unknown *'x'* on its own can often be rearranged to 'solve' it, step by step.  For example:

#!!Katex: 3x - 5 = 1
#!!Katex: 3x = 6
#!!Katex: x=2

What happens when there are several unknowns and several equations in those unknowns, and the 'unknowns' aren't 'on their own'?

##Electromagnetism Symbols

When you have all of the mathematical notation and machinery above, you also need to understand #NUTC(what the symbols) in Maxwell's equations are standing for.
#[
#!!Katex: F \,\, \text{- electromagnetic field}
#!!Katex: J \,\, \text{- electromagnetic flow}
#!!Katex: \rho \,\, \text{- charge and magnetic density}
#!!Katex: \pi \,\, \text{- the usual constant 3.1415...}
#!!Katex: i \,\, \text{- the square root of minus one}
#!!Katex: c \,\, \text{- the speed of light}

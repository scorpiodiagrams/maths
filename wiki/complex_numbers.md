#Complex Numbers

Complex number arise when you allow "the square root of minus one", also known as 'i', to be treated as a valid number.  If you extend numbers by allowing 'i' then for consistency with existing behaviour of addition and multiplication, you must allow for example 3&times;i or 4&plus;i or 4&plus;3&times;i.  The extended numbers, for consistency, must multiply and add in a particular way, and it turns out that the extended number system:
* 'works'.  You can actually treat i consistently.
* already has the square root of i (and of -i) in it.  You don't have to add new letters j, k, l etc to plug those gaps
* has interesting connections with functions in trigonometry.

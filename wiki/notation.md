##  Notation

The sometimes #NUTC(crazy) notation used 

#[
## Pet Peeves:
* $$\sin^{-1}x$$ means $$\arcsin$$
* $$\sin^2x$$ means $$(\sin x)^2$$

## Typesetters at work

Typesetters could use letters upside down when a symbol with a new meaning was needed:

* $$\forall$$ means for all, and is an upside down A
* $$\exists$$ means there exists, and is an upside down E

$$\forall$$ and $$\exists$$ do not commute!

* $$s.t.$$ means 'such that'.
* $$\top$$ is used sometimes to indicate 'true'.
* $$\bot$$ is used sometimes to indicate 'false' and is an upside down $$\top$$

 *do integrals along a curve, over a surface and over a volume...*
 *absence of a unified notation that covers both integration and sums - useful for Fourier transforms*

## Triangles

> Angles of a triangle add to 180<sup>o</sup>.  You can prove this prettily, provided you make other assumptions, such as that triangles stay the same shape when you shrink or enlarge them.

> We study right-angle triangles because all triangles can be split into two right-angle triangles.  They are great building blocks for more general triangles, which in turn are building blocks of all shapes with many sides.

> The Pythagoras theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angle triangle.  It's not obvious why it is true.  It does follow though from the subdivision of a triangle into two right-angled triangles.  There are also pretty geometric illustrations of why it is true.

> The proof of Pythagoras theorem also shows an important fact about $$\sin$$ and $$\cos$$ functions.

> Diagrams that show some relation of sizes and shapes 'must be true' need careful checking.  The pieces may only appear to fit.

## Lines and Circles

> The Bresenham algorithm for drawing a straight line is doing best approximation to a ratio.  That ratio is the slope of the line.

> The Bresenham algorithm for drawing a circle is tracking the error in squared distance.  It relies on Pythagoras.

> The CORDIC algorithm for computing $$\sin$$ and $$\cos$$ is a binary halving algorithm.  It requires a small table of angles, and synthesises results from these.

## Periodic Functions

> The $$\sin$$ and $$\cos$$ functions relate angles to coordinates.

> The Lotka-Volterra equations are differential equations that lead to periodic changes in poulation.

> The Vis-Viva equations describe the orbit of a planet.  

Graphs for these equations can present different aspects of the equations.  The differnt graphs have different uses and the relations between the graphs are also informative.

 * April 2022 * This is sketchy content that shows the general direction this content is going in.  It's way too raw at the moment.


* #Button(gist, Gists ) - Key ideas expressed more succinctly.  These make sense *after* you know the material.


### Maths Explainers
#### Toolkit
<br>These pages are foundational pieces of mathematics that act as a toolkit.
* #Button(trigonometry, Trigonometry ) - Why we 'do' triangles, and why we choose to look at right-angle triangles.
** #Button(180degrees, 180<sup>o</sup> ) - Why the angles in a triangle sum to 180<sup>o</sup>
** #Button(pythagoras, Pythagoras ) - Length of hypotenuse from the other two sides
* #Button(vectors, Vectors ) - 
* #Button(complex_numbers, Complex Numbers ) - 
* #Button(differentiation, Differentiation ) - 
* #Button(simultaneous_equations, Simultaneous Equations ) - 
* #Button(notation, Notation) - The sometimes crazy notation used in mathematics.

### Fast Calculation
#### Some Mathematical Algorithms
* #Button(bresenham_line,Lines) - The Bresenham algorithm for drawing a line
* #Button(bresenham_circle,Circles) - The Bresenham algorithm for drawing a circle
* #Button(cordic,CORDIC) - The CORDIC algorithm for fast sines and cosines.

### The Orbit Explorations
These pages are relating oscillations to 'a potential'.  Some quantity is conserved.  That quantity determines how big the oscillation is.  This is very similar to the 'conserved quantity' Breshenham algorithm for drawing a circle from the previous group of pages.
* #Button(trig_pot,Sinusoidal) - A circle is the basis for sinusoidal oscillations
* #Button(lotka_volterra,Populations) - The Lotka-Volterra equations give oscillations of populations.
* #Button(vis_viva,Vis Viva) - The Vis-Viva equations are important to orbits in a gravitational field.

### Polemics
* Pascal's triangle is square - 
* Give me a polynomial - How to construct a polynomial that 'does what you want'.
* Kinds of know how - Understanding how and knowing how to.

### Perspectives
* log - multiplication and addition are the same thing
* poles and zeroes - A rational polynomial can be looked at in terms of its coefficients or in terms of its poles and zeroes.  It's still the same polynomial.
* zeroes and minima - finding the zeroes of a funciton and finding the minimum of a function are 'the same thing'

### Maxwelly
#### something...
* #Button(simple_harmonic_motion, SHM ) - Simple Harmonic Motion
* #Button(differential_operators, Differential Operators ) - 
* #Button(maxwells_equations, Maxwell's Equations ) - 
* #Button(maxwell_the_maths, Maxwell the maths ) - 

### Explorations
#### something...
* #Button(inverting_a_nurb, Inverting a NURB ) - 
* #Button(mystery_of_FFT, Mystery of FFT ) - 

Ideas for #NUTC(future content)
#[

* Colour maths
** Why choosing a foreground (text) colour for a background is not as easy as you'd think.
** RGB of the metal colours, gold, silver, bronze.
* A PRNG
** Alternative formulations.
